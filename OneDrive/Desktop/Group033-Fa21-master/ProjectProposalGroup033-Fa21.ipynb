    "The graphics processing unit (GPU) and the central processing unit (CPU) are perhaps the two of the most important parts of PC gaming. \"A GPU is a single-chip processor thatâ€™s used chiefly to manage and enhance video and graphics performance.\"[1] The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the requirements to process input, store data, and output. They are both important in their own right. Powerful games usually require a powerful GPU and a smart CPU. Video games have been getting more advanced in terms of their video quality and AI, which requires both CPU and GPU [2]. However, there has been a lack of research and understanding, beyond the traditional perspective, about how the new releases drive hardware purchases. So, we aim to determine if the new game releases affect computer hardware sales.  \n",

    "We predict that the release of popular, graphically intensive video games is positively correlated with computer hardware sales. Traditionally, computer hardware sales would increase with the arrival of new popular games. Most of the time, new games would come with better graphics, which would require better hardware. So, in this case, one might predict that computer hardware sales might increase with the arrival of new popular games."

    "Our variables are \"increase in usage % per GPU\" and \"popular video game releases\". The data will be collected from several public datasets online and Steam surveys. Data will be organized by month. Ideally, one data set would contain the sales and popularity data of video games in certain month periods (Amount of sales, sales revenue, Playtime, Average amount of players, etc.) and another would contain sales and popularity data about various computer hardware including CPUs, GPUs, memory sticks, and more (Each containing data about their prices, sales figures, revenue, etc.). Ideally, these would be situated in a CSV file, but much of the data from steam will need to be scraped off of their website where they post their public analytics, every previous month will need to be scraped off that website through the Wayback machine."
